# Puppet-Node-Docs

Hi everyone this is Saikrishna <br />
These are my Puppet-works-part2, In here all the node information and assigned modules will reside. 

## .Yaml
In here every agent or node is given a hostname.yaml name and inside this we have all the modules information and variables values <br />
**agent.server.com.yaml** - This is the first test server <br />
**agent2.server.com.yaml** - This is the second test server <br />
**serverdefault.yaml** - This is the default heira file <br />

### Happy Coding
